# Task Management Project for React Testing Course

## Description

This project is a task management web application developed with React and Vite, specifically designed as teaching material for a course on testing in React. The application allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize tasks, as well as authenticate to maintain their personalized task lists.

The main objective of this project is to provide a practical environment for learning and applying testing techniques in React using react-testing-library. Throughout the course, students will learn to write unit and integration tests for various components and functionalities of the application, thus improving their skills in developing robust and maintainable software.

Key features that will be used for testing demonstrations include:

- User authentication
- CRUD operations for tasks
- Global state management
- API calls (simulated with json-server)
- Conditional rendering and error handling

Through this project, students will gain hands-on experience in writing effective tests, using mocks, and simulating user interactions, all within the context of a real and functional React application.

## Main Features

- User authentication
- CRUD for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Intuitive and responsive user interface
- Mock API with json-server for local development
